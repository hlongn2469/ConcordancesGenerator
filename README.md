# ConcordancesGenerator

Statement of work:

The program reads a text corpus from a file and outputs its concordance in KWIC format to cout, excluding a specified set of stop words. The stop words are read from a text file called stopwords.txt, in the same directory as the program, with one stop word per line. (Note that file name capitalization must be matched exactly.) If no stop word file exists, then the program continue without excluding any words from the concordance. The program takes the file name for the corpus file as its sole command line argument.
